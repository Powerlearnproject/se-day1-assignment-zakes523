Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, testing and developing software.
software engineering is very crucial in the tech industry, because it the backbone of the 
the digital world from complicated systems to apps. e.g.Istagram and facebook.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning:define project scope, goals, timelines and  budget.
Design:Create architectural designs and system models.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall:Linear, sequential approach
         :Rigid structure with minimal flexibility.
         :Extensive documentation.
Appropriate scenario:
 Projects with well-defined, stable requirements.

 Agile Methodology:Adaptable to changing requirements.
                  :Customer-centric.
                  :Continuous collaboration.
Appropriate scenario:
 Software development with evolving requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer:Debugging and troubleshooting  
                  :Collaborating with team members
                  :Implementing software features

Quality Assurance Engineer:Desingning test cases
                          :Ensuring software meet quality standards 
                          :Conducting regressionn testing

Project Manger:Project planning and scheduling
              :Risk management
              :Resource allocation
              
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
Examples:Visual Studio Code
        :Eclipse

Version Control Systems (VCS)
Examples:Git
        :Subversion (SVN)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements
Strategy: Implement Agile methodologies
        :Use flexible development approaches

Scalability
Strategy: Modular architecture
        :Design for future growth

Security Concerns
Strategy: Regular security audits
        :Implement secure coding practices


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
